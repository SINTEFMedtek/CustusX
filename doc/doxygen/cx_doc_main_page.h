 * \brief An IGT library.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_intro Introduction
 *
 * This page describes the architecture of CustusX3.
 *
 * The <a href="modules.html">module list</a> is a recommended starting point.
 * The modules break down the library into manageable chunks. Also read the
 * \ref cx_section_arch section.

 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_arch Architecture
 *
 * The CustusX system is divided onto four layers: \ref cx_gui , \ref cx_logic ,
 * \ref cx_service and \ref cx_resource .
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> \ref cx_resource : A collection of common utility classes available to
 * 	  everyone. A math library. Much of the SSC library can be found here.
 * 	<li> \ref cx_service : A collection of singletons providing basic services:
 * 	  Patient Model, Tracking, Video and Visualization. These provide core
 * 	  functionality to the system, along with system states.
 * 	<li> \ref cx_logic : Adds blocks of functionality on top of the services. A few core
 * 	  classes provide initialization of the services, everything else is
 * 	  added as plugins.
 * 	<li> \ref cx_gui : Graphical user interface (GUI) consisting of widgets,
 * 	  extensible by plugins.
 * </ul>
 *
 * \image html cxArchitecture_top_new.png "CX Structure"
 *
 * The layers are organized as a directed graph. A lower layer may never access
 * components from a higher layer. I.e: Logic may never control \ref cx_gui, but
 * \ref cx_logic may freely access \ref cx_logic (and \ref cx_service + \ref
 * cx_resource ). Objects within the same layer can interact, but only according
 * to the rules of that layer.
 *
 * The \ref cx_plugins extends the core by adding specific functionality. Examples of
 * plugins are: Segmentation, Registration, Data Acquisition, 3D US
 * Reconstruction and Calibration. They can be added by people not necessarily
 * part of the core team, and can depend on other plugins. A plugin typically
 * consist of a Logic part that uses the services to perform an operation, and
 * possibly GUI widgets for user interaction.
 *
 * All external libraries used by CustusX can be used by the entire system.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_legal Legal stuff
 *
 * CustusX is fully owned by SINTEF Medical Technology. CustusX source code and binaries
 * can only be used by SINTEF MT and those with explicit permission.
 * CustusX shall not be distributed to anyone else. In order to use CustusX,
 * a signed agreement with SINTEF must be made.
 *
 * CustusX contains elements from the discontinued SSC library, which is jointly owned by
 * SINTEF MT and Sonowand AS.
 *
 * CustusX contains code created by other parties, under various licenses.
 * This is described within the source code at the appropriate places.
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_install Installation
 *
 * Installation instructions can be found on the
 * <a href="http://medtek.sintef.no/wiki/projects/custusx/CustusX.html">internal SINTEF MT Wiki</a>.
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_platforms Platforms
 *
 * CustusX compiles and runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.
 * Usually the two latest Mac OSX operating system versions is supported.
 * Linux is supported on Ubuntu. It has also been tested on Fedora.
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_libs Libraries
 *
 * CX is liberal in its use of libraries. They must be installed or
 * compiled on you system in order to make CX compile.
 *
 * Adding more libraries: If a new library is needed, remember that is
 * must be available under the LGPL, BSD or similar license, and must run
 * on all platforms. It should also be easy to install on all platforms,
 * or be Cmake-compatible.
