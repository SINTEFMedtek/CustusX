/**
 * \defgroup cxService Service Layer
 * \brief A collection of singletons providing basic services:
 * 	      Patient Model, Tracking, Video and Visualization.
 *
 * The service layer consists of a collection of services that are of use to
 * the entire system. Each is a singleton. All except Visualization are
 * mutually independent, i.e. no horizontal connections exist in this layer.
 * Connections are managed in the logic layer. Detailed info on some of these
 * services can be found in Implementation 5.
 *
 *  - \ref cxServicePatient : Contains information related to the current patient.
 *    This includes entities of data, such as volumetric data, mesh data,
 *    landmarks, labels, and temporal data such as video streams. Spatial,
 *    hierarchical and temporal relations between these entities are also
 *    available.
 *  - \ref cxServiceTracking : An interface to the physical tracking devices,
 *    such as navigation pointers, US probes and surgical instruments.
 *  - \ref cxServiceVideo : An interface to realtime image stream sources such as
 *    endoscopic, ultrasound and fluoroscopy video, along with means to
 *    connect to them.
 *  - \ref cxServiceState :  Global application states: Application state 4.1,
 *    workflow state 4.2.
 *  - \ref cxServiceVisualization : Handles the layout and content of the views,
 *    i.e. visualization in 2D and 3D. This service uses the other services
 *    freely, for historical reasons.

 * Note: This service currently is a hybrid between the old ssc::DataManager

 * contains minimal functionality â€“ The PatientData class. All other info
