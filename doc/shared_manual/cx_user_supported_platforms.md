Supported Platforms {#supported_platforms}
===================
**The supported platform for CustusX is Ubuntu 20.04**

As a convenience CustusX is built continously on the following platforms, 
and installers can be downloaded, 
but full functionality cannot be expected:

| Name                          | Description
| ----------------------------- | -----------------------------
| Ubuntu 20.04, with NVidia GPU | Supported platform
| macOS 10.13 (High Sierra)     | Mac Pro
| Ubuntu 16.04                  | NVidia GPU
| Windows 10                    | NVidia GPU

In addition, CustusX may also work partially on a number of other platforms, but may have to be built from source.
