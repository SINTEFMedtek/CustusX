# Macro for defining a cppunit suite as both a standalone executable and
# a ctest-compatible set of tests.
#
# Controlled by
#   SSC_BUILD_PURE_CPPUNIT_TESTS : build the standalone exe (dont do this if doing coverage testing)
#   BUILD_TESTING : Turn off all generation
#
# Input:
#   TEST_NAME : Name of resulting cppunit executable. The corresponding ctest version will have a postfix.
#   CPPUNIT_MAIN : Name of the main function file of the classical cppunit project.
#   SOURCE_FILES : List of all source files. Remember to ad it in hyphens when calling function ( "${SOURCE_FILES}" )
#   LIBRARIES : List of all libraries. Remember to ad it in hyphens when calling function ( "${LIBRARIES}" )
