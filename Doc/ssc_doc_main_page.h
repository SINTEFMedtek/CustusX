 * \brief An IGT library used by Sonowand and Sintef Medical Technology.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section section_intro Introduction
 *
 * SSC is short for Sonowand / Sintef Medical Technology Cooperation. The
 * library was created in 2008 as a means to share code between the two
 * organizations. It has since been developed by both parties.
 *
 * The library contains a common set of interfaces that enables the
 * two companies to share software components. Please take that into account when
 * changing interfaces: You might not be the only user of a particular class.

 *
 *
 *
 * \section section_doc Documentation
 *
 * The <a href="modules.html">module list</a> is a recommended starting point.
 * The modules break down the library into manageable chunks. Also read the
 * \ref section_arch section.
 *
 * Both CustusX and Sonowand Invite documentation include ssc
 * documentation to some extent. Seek and find.
 *
 * Paper published at MICCAI 2011 on CustusX architecture (with ssc as a subset) can be found
 * <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3273">here</a> or
 * <a href="http://www.midasjournal.org/browse/publication/808">here</a>.
 *
 *
 * \section section_arch Architecture
 *
 * \image html sscArchitecture_top.png "SSC Structure"
 *
 * SSC is a collection of classes for use in an IGT application.
 *
 * The \ref sscMath module is used in the entire system.
 * \ref sscUtility and \ref sscWidget contains
 * unordered functionality. Some of it is used in the rest of ssc,
 * some is used only by client libraries.
 *
 * \ref sscData, \ref sscTool and \ref sscVideo primarily defines interfaces that
 * can be subclassed to specific implementations. Note that ssc is NOT a
 * standalone library. It is assumed that the client code implements several
 * interfaces in order to get up and running. These also modules contain some
 * functionality build in top of the interfaces.
 *
 * The \ref sscRep module primarily contains Rep (representation) subclasses.
 * They form the core of ssc. Each Rep is capable of visualizing entities
 * based on information from the data layer.
 *
 * The Reps must be added to a View in order to be shown on screen. A View
 * represents either a 2D or 3D (or Video) scene. A View cab be integrated into
 * a Qt application like any other QWidget.
 *
 * \image html sscArchitecture_view.png "View structure"
 *
 * Check out ToolRep3D and Texture3DSlicerRep for detailed examples of how a Rep is connected
 * to the View and data layer.
 *
 * SSC also contains secondary libraries for DICOM and ultrasound support. TBD.
 *
 *
 * \subsection section_update_policy Update policy
 *
 * The vtk rendering pipeline is updated when Render() in the vtkRenderWindow inside
 * View is called. The application using SSC is supposed to contain a QTimer or similar
 * that calls Render() at a certain update rate.
 *
 * The internal structure of SSC is updated whenever something changes, using Qt signals.
 * I.e, when a Data object changes, all Rep instances that use it will update immediately.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section section_legal Legal stuff
 *
 * SSC is owned by SINTEF MedTech and SonoWand AS. It can be used by both parties in
 * any way. A written agreement exists that regulates the usage.
 * SSC contains code created by other parties, under various licenses. This is
 * described within the source code at the appropriate places.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section section_install Installation
 *
 * The source can be downloaded from
 * \verbatim git@github.com:SINTEFMedisinskTeknologi/SSC.git \endverbatim
 *
 * Use
 * \verbatim git clone git@github.com:SINTEFMedisinskTeknologi/SSC.git \endverbatim
 * to clone the repository.
 *
 * You need to have a Github account and be added to the user
 * group by an administrator.
 *
 * Howtos on installation can be found on the CustusX wiki:
 * http://medtekserver.sintef.no/groups/custusx This is partly in
 * norwegian, and only available from inside Sintef.
 *
 * SSC compiles and runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.
 * Some features are available only one some of the OS.
 *
 * \section section_libs Libraries
 *
 * SSC is liberal in its use of libraries. They must be installed or
 * compiled on you system in order to make SSC compile.
 *
 * Adding more libraries: If a new library is needed, remember that is
 * must be available under the LGPL license or similar, and must run
 * on all platforms. It should also be easy to install on all platforms,
 * or be Cmake-compatible.
