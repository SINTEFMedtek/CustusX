/** \brief Interface for all classes following the modified/prepaint paradigm.
 *
 * Use this class when the widget is modified several times
 * between each repaint. Instead of doing expensive computations
 * upon setModified(), the computations are rather deferred to
 * a pre paint step.
 * This is similar to the VTK modified/update paradigm.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *  In order for this to work, the widget itself must have a visible region.
 *  If the widget is completely covered by child widgets or other widgets,
 *  no paintEvent will come, and the prePaintEvent will not be called.
 *  See ScalarInteractionWidget for an example of how to hack this if necessary.
