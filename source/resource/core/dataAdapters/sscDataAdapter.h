/**\brief Superclass for all data adapters.
 *
 * The data adapters are an abstraction mechanism that separates
 * data values from the user interface. Data adapters for strings,
 * doubles, booleans and so on publish their value in a generic
 * manner, thus enabling us to write generic widgets for displaying
 * and changing them.
