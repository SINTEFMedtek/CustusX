 *
 * \section cx_section_clinical_application_state Clinical Application State
 *
 * The active clinical application is known to the entire system.
 * The options are:
 *
 *  - Laboratory
 *  - Neurology
 *  - Laparascopy
 *  - Bronchoscopy
 *  - Endovascular
 *
 * The application can be used to customize the system to that clinical
 * area. Each one are represented as a state in StateManager. Currently the
 * tool configurations, the workflow states and the view orientations are
 * affected by this.
 *
 * \sa ApplicationStateMachine
 *
 *
 * \section cx_section_workflow Workflow
 *
 * The use of CustusX during a surgical procedure can be broken down into a series of steps:
 *
 *  - Preoperative data acquisition
 *  - Planning
 *  - Registration
 *  - Navigation + Intraoperative data acquisition.
 *  - Postoperative analysis
 *
 * This is the main workflow. Each step is named a Workflow State, and are
 * states in StateManager. They can be customized in the State Manager, and
 * they have a unique GUI setup.
 *
 * \image html workflow_steps_small.png "Workflow steps. The buttons are enlarged."
 *
 * \sa WorkflowStateMachine
 *
 * During each step, There are operations that usually are performed in
 * sequence. Examples:
 *
 *  - Acquire data -> reconstruct.
 *  - Import/acquire data -> show in view.
 *
 * These automations can be set in Preferences->Automation.
