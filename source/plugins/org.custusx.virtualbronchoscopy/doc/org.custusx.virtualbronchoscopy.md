Visualization Method Plugin: Virtual Bronchoscopy {#org_custusx_virtualbronchoscopy}

Virtual Bronchoscopy visualisation {#org_custusx_virtualbronchoscopy_widget}
===========================================================

This is a method used to visualise a generated path for bronchoscopy. Use the the airways filter (Linux verions only)
to create an airways centerline. Use that as an input to the \ref org_custusx_filter_routetotarget.
Set the camera mode to *Tool* view so that the camera will follow the route.
Set the generated route to target as the path and use the slider and the wheels to navigate inside the airways of your volume.
You can use the arrows, page up/down and the number 5 key to control the camera (as long as the focus is on the VB widget).
