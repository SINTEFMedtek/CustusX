This is a powerful filter library which implements all 
standard IIR filters such as Bessel, Butterworth, 
Elliptic and Chebychev. The data format is
floating-point throughout.

There is no need to resort to MATLAB/OCTAVE to calculate
the filter coefficients because the library does it
by itself. Just provide the sampling rate, cutoff
frequency, filter order and the filter is
ready to be used.

Installation is done with the standard sequence:
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

Usage is very simple. A demo program is in the
"demo" directory which sets up a lowpass and a bandstop 
filter. A delta pulse is sent into the filters 
and saved as a gnuplot/octave file. 
For the documentation have a look at
Documentation.txt

This library has been adapted form Vinnie Falco's
original work which can be found here:
https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters

The main advancement from the original library is
the implementation of the "filter" function
so that the IIR filter can be used in realime
applications. This has been achieved by just
re-shuffling existing code and making it available
to the user in form of the API call "filter".

Enjoy!
